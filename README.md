AI Usage 
AI assistance was used for:
Generating additional quiz questions
Debugging specific JavaScript logic (event listeners and restart logic)
Explaining how DOM manipulation works
Suggesting improvements to styling
All core implementation, structure, integration, and understanding of the project were done independently.
The majority of the project logic, file structure, debugging, and customization were written and adjusted manually.
